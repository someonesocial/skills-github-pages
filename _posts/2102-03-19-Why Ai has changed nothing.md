In the early twenty-first century, the world was gripped by the promise—and fear—of artificial intelligence. Headlines raved about smart machines transforming everything from work to relationships. Dystopian novels and tech evangelists alike prophesied a future where nothing would be the same. But now, from the vantage point of 2102, it’s clear: AI has changed nothing.

The Hype That Was
Back in the 2020s, every industry scrambled to “integrate” AI. We got smarter phones, slightly better chatbots, and a few impressive robots. There were promises of limitless productivity and universal leisure. Some even claimed AI would solve climate change, cure disease, or end hunger.

But look around today. Despite all the algorithms, most of our challenges remain frustratingly human: inequality, loneliness, political division, and, yes, the never-ending piles of paperwork.

Human Nature, Unchanged
The core reason is simple: technology changes, but human nature doesn’t. AI can process data, but it can’t resolve our age-old tendencies—greed, empathy, jealousy, hope. We still struggle to listen, collaborate, and trust. The tools have become smarter, but the people using them remain the same.

Consider work. AI was supposed to free us from drudgery. Yet, in 2102, most people still work long hours, only now with more “efficiency reports” generated by AI. Automation created new problems and new jobs, but did not liberate us from the grind. The dream of abundant leisure remains just that—a dream.

Old Problems, New Tools
Certainly, AI has made some things faster. Medical diagnoses are more accurate. Transportation is more reliable. But these are incremental improvements, not revolutions. The rich still get richer. The poor still struggle. The environment is still in peril—only now, with real-time pollution predictions and automated recycling robots.

Even creativity, once thought uniquely human, is now accompanied by AI-generated art and music. But the best works still resonate because of the messy, unpredictable human experience behind them.

The Illusion of Change
We expected AI to fundamentally alter society, but society is stubborn. History shows that new technologies rarely change core values or solve deep-seated issues. The steam engine didn’t end class struggle. The internet didn’t create a utopia of understanding. And AI hasn’t transformed what it means to be human.

What Has Changed?
Perhaps the only thing that’s truly changed is our expectation of change. We’ve learned, after a century of AI, that progress is not a magic trick. It’s slow, difficult, and always filtered through the unchanging complexity of human life.

So, as we enter the next century, let’s temper our expectations. AI is just another tool. The real work—the real change—still starts and ends with us.

- 2102 and still human, after all.
